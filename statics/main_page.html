    <h3>Bridge Culture Museum | 2023.2~2023.8(Expected) | Project Manager</h3>
    <p>
        Software project derived from a national boutique course in Central South University (Poems & Bridge).

    <h3>National Level Innovation and Entrepreneurship project | 2022.5~2023.4(Expected) | co-leader</h3>
    <p>
        Kuramoto model-based Modelling and Application of Brain Structural and Functional Network (Still in process). Aiming to build up the functional network(FC Network) with 
        structural network(SC Network) as the method to get SC netwrok is much easier than FC network's. This project is a joint application with Tianjin Normal University and 
        Shanghai University of Financial and Economics.
